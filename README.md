# Vulcaner V1 Beta
Vulcaner is a roblox executor template for roblox executors that need APIs.
###### for this executor to work you need to download an API such as WRD or EasyXploits ( which are down right now. )

# UI
Here is a picture of what the UI looks like!

Pretty cool huh?

Sadly it won't work, BUT I'm learning C# & C++ and I might be able to make it work without the need of APIs!

### might work with NetflixCE or Chaos V3....
